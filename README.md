# Wav2Lip-Pre-trained-Models-GAN-NOGAN
This repository provides pre-trained checkpoint files for the Wav2Lip model, specifically the GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) and NOGAN (Non-GAN) versions. These files are intended for easy cloning and use in projects that require high-quality, audio-driven lip synchronization.
